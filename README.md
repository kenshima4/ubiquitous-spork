# Detailed Assignment Instructions:
## Backend:
1. Build a PHP restful API capable of performing the following operations:
    - The backend should be able to ingest the following payload:
        ```json
        {
            "Unit Name": "String",
            "Arrival": "<dd-mm-yyyy>",
            "Departure": "<dd-mm-yyyy>",
            "Occupants": <int>,
            "Ages": [<int array>]
        }
        ```
    - Post API call to the following address with the converted payload:
      [Remote API Address](https://dev.gondwana-collection.com/Web-Store/Rates/Rates.php)
        - Mutate your ingested payload to the following format to fit the parameters of the remote API:
        ```json
        {
            "Unit Type ID": <int>,
            "Arrival": "yyyy-mm-dd",
            "Departure": "yyyy-mm-dd",
            "Guests": [
                {
                    "Age Group": "Adult"
                },
                {
                    "Age Group": "Adult"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    - Relay the obtained rates back to the frontend
    - Use the following Unit Type IDs [-2147483637,-2147483456] for testing. 
## Frontend:
1. Construct a simple, interactive and user-friendly frontend to send requests to your API and display the responses.
    - The frontend should aid the users in visualising the following data:
        - Unit Name
        - Rate
        - Date Range
        - Availability
        
- The UI design is left to your discretion and creativity, however, the emphasis should be on functionality and user experience.

Thank you for your interest and we look forward to reviewing your work! Good luck.
